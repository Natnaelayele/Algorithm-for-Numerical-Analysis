### Algorithm for Numerical Analysis

solving nonlinear equations using different types of numerical methods.
- Bisection Method
- interpolation (false position) method
- iteration Method
- Newton Raphson Method

---
This Repo have only the first two method algorithms in c++ languange you can implemente in any language you want the algorithms based on the certain equation those equations
- bisection equation
Solve the equation 𝑥^3 − 5𝑥 + 3 = 0 using the Bisection method in the interval [0,1] with error 𝜀 = 0.001.
- interpolation method
the function 𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑥^3 − 𝑥^2 − 1 has exactly one zero in [1,2]. Use method of false position to approximate the zero of 𝑓 to within the tolerance 10−4
